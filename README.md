# Design Brief for Open Source Projects

Open Source is great for developers. It feels right and makes sense to us. Does it work or feel right for designers? I'm not so sure.

This project is an attempt to create a Design Brief template for Open Source Projects to encourage designers to join in. Designers like to ask certain questions and have certain knowledge before they start pushing pixels or choosing colors. If we can include a document in our projects that answers those questions, it may give designers a jumping off point that they can use to get started

### Contributing

I'm flying a little blind on this, so all contributions are welcome. Feel free to branch and pull request in. Thanks.

- Crowdfunding
- End User Purchases
- Grants
- Industry Partnerships

## Non-Monetary Funding

- Employees who are allowed to work "part-time" on personal projects
- People who commit to finishing X, Y, and Z features (not money but just as good?)
