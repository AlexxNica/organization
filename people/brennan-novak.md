My name is Brennan Novak. I am formally trained designer and informally trained hacker. I'm an internet builder who's most curious about social technology, sustainable design, and biophilia. I'm a co-founder of Mailpile and work as a UI / UX designer and software engineer. I have an experimental psychology project called emoome. I like to contribute to the #IndieWeb as it is helping the internet become redecentralized.
