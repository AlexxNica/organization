Hi! I'm Caty. I'm the interaction designer for the open source project [XWiki.org](http://www.xwiki.org), which is a generic platform for developing collaborative applications. I'm based in Iasi, Romania. 

Where I live the open source design activity is mostly non-existent, so I'm glad I can participate in this initiative and make sure open source projects will be much easier to use / nicer to look at / interact with.
